    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making chicken pot pie in a pan doesn't sound all that revolutionary, and it's not, since that's where many people make it anyway, but since it comes out so differently than deeper dish versions, and according to me, so much better, I decided we need to start calling it what it really is. Chicken pan pie. Which I think has a nice ring to it.  </p>
    <p> By using a shallow frying pan to construct our pie, we're not only getting a higher crust to filling ratio, but the moisture inside tends to reduce, resulting in a more intense, more flavorful, and much thicker filling. Some might say the filling gets "drier," but I don't like that word, since nothing about this is even remotely dry.  </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9¼ cup unsalted butter </li>
        <li>⅔ cup diced onion </li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste  </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 cup milk </li>
        <li>2 ½ cups chicken broth </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine </li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes</li>
    </ol>
